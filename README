The package sudokurapid consists of 3 parts:

1. libsudokuRapid - the static library you may use in your own sudoku projects
2. sudokuRapidConsole - simple console application which uses libsudokuRapid
3. sudokuRapidQt - simple graphical application which uses libsudokuRapid


Dependencies:

libsudokuRapid - only C++ standard library and STL
sudokuRapidConsole - only C++ standard library and STL
sudokuRapidQt - C++ standard library and Qt >= 4.4


You can skip building applications by using
--disable-sudokuRapidConsole and --disable-sudokuRapidQt options
in configure script

Another configure option --enable-debug will make it possible to watch solution
stack dynamics on stdout (and maybe other information in future releases).

You can find all the options that you can set using
./configure --help

The package will install lib/libsudokuRapid.a,
bin/sudokuRapidConsole (if not disabled), bin/sudokuRapidQt (if not disabled),
include/sudokuRapid.h, share/sudokurapid/ in directory specified by prefix
option of configure script, for example:
./configure --prefix=/usr
will install the files in /usr directory, if prefix is not specified the package
will install in /usr/local

You will find 2 board examples board1.txt and board2.txt in
<your_prefix>share/sudokurapid/ directory - 1 good and 1 bad, try to load them
in sudokuRapidConsole by running for instance:
sudokuRapidConsole <your_prefix>/share/sudokurapid/board1.txt
button 'Open' in sudokuRapidQt will do the same by opening File Open dialog.
