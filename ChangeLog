1.4:
	libsudokuRapid:
	- source file main.cc for sudokuRapidConsole was added in package share
	directory.

	sudokuRapidQt:
	- freedesktop.org compliant .desktop and icon files were created which
	means that user will see menu entry with an icon in his/her desktop menu.
	- hints became clickable which means that user can abandon the keyboard at
	all: just right click on a cell and left click on a value to be set (the
	possible values will be highlighted when hovering).
	- dynamic_cast's were changed with qgraphicsitem_cast's.

1.3:
	sudokuRapidQt:
	- show hints and gray out board on errors.
	- check if user clicked Cancel button in File Open dialog and do not
	restart board in this case.
	- move font definitions for cells to SudokuScene constructor;
	use QFontMetrics to define font geometry in SudokuCell::drawNumber(),
	this allows to use arbitrary fonts smoothly.

1.2:
	libsudokuRapid:
	- added new header sudokuRapidCommon.h to store shared typedefs, enums
	etc.
	- added new public function getFreeValues().

	sudokuRapidQt:
	- code was significantly reorganized.
	- file reading procedure changed to show all data read: do not stop at
	sudokuRapid errors and just highlight them, it is possible now to show
	errors when sudokuRapid deduces value for cell which is assigned with
	another value from file.
	- no error message boxes: just highlight error cells and disable board
	interaction.
	- user can find which values are available for cell by clicking right
	mouse button or pressing Space or Enter keys.
	- colors for values read from a file or entered by user differ from colors
	deduced by sudokuRapid.

1.1:
	libsudokuRapid:
	- readFromFile() removed from the library - this is responsibility
	of clients to read files.
	- fixed bug in solve() which caused exception in sudokuRapidQt when
	Solve button were pressed on already solved board.
	- option --enable-debug was added in configure, if enabled user will
	see solution stack dynamics on stdout.

	sudokuRapidConsole:
	- readFromFile() added (just moved from basic class).

	sudokuRapidQt:
	- bugfix: minor grid lines now do not redraw major lines.
	- added possibility to disable board from user interaction (when error
	occured).
	- more robust error messages and error cell highlighting.

1.0:
	The first public version.
	The code was separated into library and 2 applications parts.
